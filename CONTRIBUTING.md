## How to contribute to Gazer

Did you read the [code of conduct](https://github.com/looker-open-source/gzr/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)?

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/looker-open-source/gzr/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/looker-open-source/gzr/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Depending on the content of the patch, we may need to work out a legal agreement to clarify everyone's rights before the patch is accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

*  Again please open an issue in GitHub. Larger projects often segregate bugs from new features and enhancements, but we are still small enough that it is not an issue.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use Gazer by contacting the [primary developer](mailto:deangelo+gzr@looker.com).

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
